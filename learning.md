---------|------
[https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/) | Tinkercad is a wonderfully simply and easy to use online CAD editor that you can use to create 3D models for printing. They have a stack of short tutorials that help you to quickly get up to speed using their webware.
[http://www.autodesk.com/](http://www.autodesk.com/) | Tinkercad was created by a company called Autodesk who also provide excellent desktop CAD software. There's much more of a learning curve here than tinkercad so if you're new to 3D modelling stick with Tinkercad.
[http://www.sketchup.com/](http://www.sketchup.com/) | SketchUp is another good CAD program, but again there's quite a learning curve you've got to get through before diving into anything too complex.
